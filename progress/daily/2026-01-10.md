## Completions
- Mod Development
    - Started setting up inital mod configurations for AltherisExperiment.
    - Linked Github folder location to the mod location using mklink.

## Next Focus
- Mod Development
    - Finish initial mod setup with some adjustments to the mods to see they are working.

## Notes
- AltherisExperiment is the basic tutorial mod that I am digging through with the documentation.
- mklink allowed the mod files to be in 2 locations while keeping them in sync.  This allowed me to keep the folder structure how I want
