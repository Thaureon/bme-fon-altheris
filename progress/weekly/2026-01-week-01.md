# Week 1 - January 2026
📅 January 1 - January 3, 2026

## Summary
The first week focused on project setup and initial research into Satisfactory modding.
Time was primarily spent establishing repository structure, defining the progress tracking
system, and understanding what tools, frameworks, and documentation are required to begin
creating mods.

No in-game changes were implemented yet, but the groundwork for mod development was
successfully established.

## What Worked
- Setting up a consistent project and progress structure early
- Defining clear expectations for daily vs weekly logging
- Researching the Satisfactory Mod Loader (SML) and basic mod setup requirements
- Keeping research tasks broad rather than prematurely diving into implementation

## What Didn't
- Underestimated the amount of initial research required before touching gameplay changes
- No hands-on mod creation yet, which made progress feel slower early in the week

## Next Week
- Create a minimal Satisfactory mod project
- Verify the mod loads correctly in-game
- Begin experimenting with adding a simple custom resource
