# bme-fon-altheris

**bme-fon-altheris** is a learning-focused project within the **Before Month’s End – Finished Or Not (BME-FON)** series.

This project follows a monthly, time-boxed format. Each BME-FON project begins on the **first day of the month** and concludes on the **last day of the month**, regardless of completion state.

For this iteration, the project runs from:

**📅 January 1, 2026 → January 31, 2026**

## Project Intent

This repository serves as an exploration of modding for Satisfactory.

The initial focus of the project is on making small, targeted modifications to the base game in order to understand the modding pipeline, data structures, and gameplay integration points.

Areas of exploration include:
* Adding new resources
* Creating custom recipes
* Understanding how those elements integrate into existing production chains
* Creating menu options

As familiarity increases, the project will also explore the creation of a randomizer, introducing controlled randomness into aspects of the game to better understand data-driven systems and mod behavior.

## Scope & Flexibility

This project is intentionally exploratory.

The scope may shift throughout the month as new modding concepts, limitations, or opportunities are discovered. Some features may remain incomplete or experimental as part of the learning process.

The goal is understanding systems and workflows rather than producing a fully polished or publicly released mod.

## BME-FON Philosophy

This project follows the **Finished Or Not** approach:

- Time-boxed learning
- Progress over perfection
- Iteration over abandonment

The repository represents learning in motion rather than a finalized product.
